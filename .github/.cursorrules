For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this app supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

Whenever possible, separate the logic from the data. Respect best practices in code organisation, and check the codebase for relevant prior structuration when needed.

When writing content in French, respect the French grammar and spelling usage, and the French way of writing. In particular, do not capitalize the first letter of each word in titles.
